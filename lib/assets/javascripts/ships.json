The resulting vessel maintained the shield defenses known among similar ships of its type, while adding an array of remarkable black ops capabilities.

In YC114 each major empire faction, having been embroiled in a harrowing, extensive, long-term war, recognized the growing need for support and logistics functionality in their vessels during the kind of protracted interstellar warfare that might otherwise prove exhausting for its participants. In the Amarr Empire, this led to the redesign and redeployment of the Inquisitor.

The Inquisitor was originally an example of how the Amarr Imperial Navy modeled their design to counter specific tactics employed by the other empires. After its redesign, it was exclusively devoted to the role of a support frigate, and its formerly renowned missile capabilities gave way to a focus on remote armor repair.

In YC114 each major empire faction, having been embroiled in a harrowing, extensive, long-term war, recognized the growing need for support and logistics functionality in their vessels during the kind of protracted interstellar warfare that might otherwise prove exhausting for its participants.

The Osprey originally offered excellent versatility and power for what was considered a comparably low price.

When Ishukone Watch was commissioned to produce a run of Scorpion-class battleships for its parent company, it was decided that a number of extra units would be offered to the capsuleer community to help fund the effort. Interestingly, the entire project took less than one year from start to finish, suggesting at some degree of urgency in the fleet\'s production.

<font color=white><u>Technology</u></font>
Though the typical Scorpion-class battleship includes a highly advanced sensor package, Ishukone Watch modifies their ships for policing duty around their worlds. Custom multispectral radiation scanners designed to catch all forms of planetary and extra-planetary communications replace the standard comms suite. Special LADAR and thermal imaging equipment allow Ishukone Watch ships to serve as a distant eye-in-the-sky for planetary security forces. Although these features are stripped out before decommissioned hulls are placed on the open market, the infamy of the Ishukone Watch still makes ships popular with independent ship buyers.

<font color=white><u>Notes</u></font>
Many wonder why Ishukone Watch would produce a massive run of electronic warfare battleships, especially with sensor suites fine-tuned to detect planetside signals. Some have speculated that these ships were intended to support a larger, multinational fleet. Regarding the mass production of these ships, Ishukone Watch CEO Eborimi Shiskala praised her parent corporation with an \"incredible dedication to the Ishukone doctrine of technological superiority.\"

In YC114 each major empire faction, having been embroiled in a harrowing, extensive, long-term war, recognized the growing need for support and logistics functionality in their vessels during the kind of protracted interstellar warfare that might otherwise prove exhausting for its participants. Both Frigate and Cruiser-class ships were put under the microscope, and in the Minmatar Republic  the outcome of the re-evaluation process led, among other developments, to a redesign and redeployment of the Scythe.

The Scythe-class cruiser remains the oldest Minmatar ship still in use. It has seen many battles and is an integrated part in Minmatar tales and heritage. With its redesign, past firmware upgrades for mining output were tossed out entirely in favor of two new separate systems that focused on shield transporting and logistics drones respectively.","mass": 11110000,"volume": 89000,"capacity": 475,"portionSize": 1,"raceID": 2,"basePrice": 2877500.0000,"published": 1,"marketGroupID": 73,"chanceOfDuplicating": 0.07,"groupName": "Cruiser","raceName": "Minmatar","marketGroupName": "Minmatar","marketParentGroupName": "Standard Cruisers"}, {"typeID": 29336,"groupID": 26,"typeName": "Scythe Fleet Issue","description": "The Scythe Fleet Issue is a throwback to earlier days of Minmatar ship design, when the scarcity of resources meant that a single ship needed to be able to do almost everything.

The exhumer is the second generation of mining vessels created by <a href=showinfo:30//500014>ORE</a>. Exhumers, like their mining barge cousins, were each created to excel at a specific function, the Skiff\'s being durability. With that in mind, the designers could only make space to fit one mining or ice harvesting module. To mitigate the effect this would have on its mining output, they came up with a unique loading system that allows this one module to work at triple efficiency.
Exhumers are equipped with electronic subsystems specifically designed to accommodate Strip Mining and Ice Harvesting modules.","mass": 10000000,"volume": 100000,"capacity": 350,"portionSize": 1,"raceID": 128,"basePrice": 6878488.0000,"published": 1,"marketGroupID": 874,"chanceOfDuplicating": 0.07,"groupName": "Exhumer","raceName": "ORE","marketGroupName": "Exhumers","marketParentGroupName": "Mining Barges"}, {"typeID": 585,"groupID": 25,"typeName": "Slasher","description": "The Slasher is an Attack Frigate designed for fast aggressive combat.
